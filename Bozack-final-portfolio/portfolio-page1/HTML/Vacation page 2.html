		<h3>Information about Australia</h3>
		<p>Australia is best known for The Great Barrier Reef, the most colorful and beautiful barrier reef in the world. If you are not into snorkeling though, Australia has plenty more to offer. Australia is a great place for road trips! Its famous Great Ocean road is just part of the long expanse of road throughout the continent, which you can spend days or weeks traveling. Australia still conserves some of its Aboriginal culture, and one of the Aboriginal's most sacred places is Uluru. Uluru is part of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. </p>

		<h3>Why I reccomend Australia</h3>

		<p>I love road trips, and Australia is one of the best places in the world for road trips. There is so much to explore, and that kind of adventure is a lot of fun for me. I also love snorkeling, and nothing beats the Great Barrier Reef when it comes to snorkeling. Australia is one of my dream vacation spots, and definately a place you could make multiple trips out of.</p>
