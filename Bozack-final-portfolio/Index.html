                <h2>About me</h2> <p>I am a sophmore attending Bernardsville High School, interested in subjects such as physics and psychology and play clarinet in the school concert band. I do well in school and have almost all A's in my classes. I am the stage manager for the musical at my school, and had this position for the previous play. I have taken part in several plays in the past and have operated both sound and lighting equipment. I am a boy scout in my local troop and have organized several service projects. I am currently working on the rank of Eagle, which I hope to obtain within the next few months.</p>
