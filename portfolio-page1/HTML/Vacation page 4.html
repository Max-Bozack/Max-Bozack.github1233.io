	<h3>Information about Machu Picchu</h3>
	<p>Machu Picchu is a 15th century Inca citadel located on a 7,790 ft mountain ridge in southern Peru. There are quite a lot of ruins on this ridge, which archeologists believe were part of an estate for the Incan emperor Pachacuti. It is estimated that around 750 people worked at this estate, who were religious specialists and specialized workers. Agriculture was done on man made terraces along the steep mountain side. It is widely believed that Machu Picchu was abandoned because the Incan ruler was fleeing from incoming Spainish armies. After the Spainish took over the region, there was no way to return.</p><br>

	<h3>Why I reccomend Machu Picchu</h3>
	<p>I do a lot of hiking. I have climbed to some pretty high places and the view is alway worth it. With Machu Picchu, not only is the view amazing, but the top is just as cool. Incan ruins from hundreds of years ago, surrounded by lush rainforest, sounds incredible. Rain forests are always hot and humid, but at that elevation, there is a cool mountain breeze with a breath taking view. Machu Picchu will always be one of my top vacation spots.<p><br><br>
