	<h3>Information about Victoria Falls</h3>
	<p>Victoria Falls is a waterfall located on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe in Africa, and is one of the largest waterfalls in the world. The whole waterfall spans about 2 km and goes into a gorge one hundred meters below. The scenery around the falls is made up of basalt cliffs and a lush rainforest. Just being near the falls you can feel the power of the water. It was rightfully nicknamed: "The Smoke that Thunders" by a native tribe in the area.<p><br><br>

	<h3>Why I reccomend Victoria Falls</h3>
	<p>I have always found waterfalls beautiful. No matter how large, there is something majestic about them. I have seen Niagara Falls and several great waterfalls thoughout the United States. None of these can compare to Victoria falls. It is something I want to experience and something I think everyone should experience as well.</p>
